# talk2me
For the BuildIllinois Hackathon 2023

We created this project because we want to see more collaboration and connection between communities, and so we created a discord bot that we believe can do just that. Talk2Me is a discord bot that allows different servers to communicate with eachother via the bot, where the bot will relay information and messages sent in a channel between the servers. We believe this approach will allow for communities to better interact with eachother without the complicated mess of creating new servers or groupchats, but rather by simply creating a platform between servers that allows for communication without the hassle. We believe this bot can help connect different communities anywhere, and we hope that this bot can be used as a tool to further connections between communities and allow for collaborations that would have been more difficult to organize without a tool like Talk2Me.
